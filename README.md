# ForestOperator

We present a software that is a collection of tools for dealing with combinatorial aspects related to Godel logic and NM-logic.
Dual spaces of the algebraic counterparts of such logics can be described in terms of trees and forests. We developed tools to build algebras starting from duals, and to graphically represent both of them. Further, we calculate duals of free Godel algebras and NM-algebras, by implementing the operation of product between forests in the appropriate category. Finally, we show how to visualize the interpretation of any formula as the proper subforest of the free algebra.
